## About

Bristol: home of Banksy, Aardman, Concorde and great cider. And, after London, the UK's leading hub of digital enterprise. In 2013, we set up [CodeHub](http://www.codehub.org.uk) to create a space for developers to learn from one another. Seeing that it was quite similar to OpenTechSchool, we decided to join the global network.

We are part of a proud culture of technical groups and meetups. Check out:<br />
- Bristol WebFolk's [calendar of tech events](http://bristolwebfolk.github.io/calendar/)<br />
- Possibly Bristol's longest-running series of web tech events, [Skillswap](http://bristolskillswap.org/)
