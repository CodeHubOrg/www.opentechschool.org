Over the time certain practices became the common way of how we do things. These documents are trying to capture best practices which have been proven to work. But don't understand any of that as written in stone: not only do we constantly improve on the way we do things, we might also be wrong here and there or our approaches don't work for the given problem. Please do not hestitate to raise any question you have about them via our [global dicsussions mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/discuss.global).
