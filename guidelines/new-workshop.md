title: How to organise a new workshop
---

Do you have a topic you're passionate about? Do you have the skills and maybe even an idea how to help people learn about it? Can you imagine there will be a demand for your workshop? If so, let us help you organise it!

# Pre-requirements
Before we can get started, there are a few things we need to ensure first. Those are:

 1. Make sure the workshop and its idea is in agreement with our [values](/values.html). In particular:
  * even though your workshop may be targeting a certain group of people and could have some prequisites (like certain skills/hardware/software), it needs to be as open and inclusive as possible
  * it needs to be hands-on
  * you are responsible for creating a safe learning environment where learners are encouraged to ask questions and nothing is assumed to be "self-explanatory"
  * FIXME: anything else?

 2. Show us there is a demand for your workshop (e.g. by posting it on our [global discussion groups](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/discuss.global).)

 3. Have an idea of what you want to workshop/learning material to include - the clearer the idea, the easier it becomes to recruit coaches

 * Get in touch with OpenTechSchool people (which you might have already done via the mailinglist) and discuss your idea. Someone may already be working on something similar, so it makes sense to join forces.

In order to make organisation easier, once you've contacted the OpenTechSchool team, find someone who is passionate about helping you organise the workshop from within OpenTechSchool or who has at least done such a thing before. We call this person "the co-host" and you are referred to as the "lead coach". As this co-host might not have access to everything, this document refers to OTS as the organisation team in general.

# Starting to organise

Even if you already have a pretty clear idea of what you want to do and may even have some learning material ready, we strongly believe that more people working together yield bigger results. In any case, you want to have some other people helping you coach, so the next things OTS is going to do are:

 * Create a mailing list for this topic
 * Promote that mailinglist via our social media channels, spread it in our mailinglist, user groups and communinities
 * Make a public call for coaches on our blog - the more clearly your idea is described there, the better

But we also need to you to spread the word and convince people to join - after all, it is your cause!

## scheduling first meeting
Once there are enough people in the mailinglist (we usually wait until there are 25-30), we try to set up a first meeting in order to get to know each other as well as figure out how to actually get things done.

 * We create a doodle poll to find a good time within the next 2-4 weeks
 * Sent this to the coaches list and ask everyone to put their availabilities
 * Reshare this via the Social Media Channels
 * Once there are enough coaches available for a date (8-10 at least), this is set and sent to the mailinglist.

_Note_: We recommend meeting on a weekday evening after work hours, monday to thursday work best in our experience.

## at the meeting

 * The meeting is moderated by the lead coach and the cohost
 * Making a short introduction round to get the names and occupations as well as the motivation to be there straigent out, helps a lot
 * then start discussing.

Common goals for a first meeting usually are:
 * Getting to know the ground, goals and availabilities of the coaches
 * Setting a milestone on what to achieve next - this could be anything from a next meeting to talk more up to the date and time for the first time the workshop takes place.
