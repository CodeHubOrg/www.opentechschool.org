about: "We are the very first OpenTechSchool local team – the early birds! The venue that supported us from the very beginning and where we're hosting our events is the fantastic co-working space co.up. This is also where we have our bi-weekly breakfast meeting – the best way to meet us and talk together about new ideas and projects!"
