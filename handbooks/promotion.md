title: Promotion Guidelines
---

As OpenTechSchool we have certain [values](/values.html), areas of intrest and goal we want to achieve. Fortunately we are not the only ones but there are others following similar goals and serving those interests. And as we believe in cooperation over competetion we are really happy to help promote them and their activities (such as events) as well.

As this organisation we are often approached by various entities and people and asked whether we can help them promote their cause. This guidelines is supposed to guide your through the decision of whether the OpenTechSchool as a brand shall and will promote this cause and activity.

1. It needs to fall in line with our values and should have our goals at heart - that should be a no-brainer.

2. We do not promote for money.

3. We do promote events, workshops, ideas and concepts and sometimes institutions and factilities.

4. We do not promote jobs, product or service offers or coupons, advertising or any such thing.

4. As we understand education as a tool to empower people we've decided to not promote any workshops participants have to pay for.
 
5. It should be about about a technology, tech method or tech culture - we do not promote workshops on accounting for doctors.

6. We do not promote workshops hosted by companies or agency to promote their product or service or recruiting.

7. We like hands-on experience - if it consists soley of talks, we are harder to convince.

If - after reading this - you are still unsure whether OTS does want to promote the inquiry you received, just forward it to the team-mailinglist of your local team asking that exact question and what kind of promotion you'd suggest. With a simple voting of "-1" and "+1" the team members than decide with simple majority voting on that topic.
