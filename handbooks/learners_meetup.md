A Learners Meetup is an event aiming at everyone who's learning to code, to develop software or anything tech related. This includes both absolute beginners as well as developers who want to get new tech skills and get into passionate conversations about it. After all: we are all Learners!

This is at the same an event that can help building the community around OTS and keep it engaged, offering a regular event happening monthly as reference meeting point for learners who want to ask questions or present their latest projects (sometimes as an OTS workshop follow-up: full circle!), coaches willing to offer their skills joining the night's discussions and anyone interested in participating in a skill enchange.

# How does a Learners Meetup work?

It's a 2-hour event, in three parts: two talks, a break and a Learn'n'Tell session.


1. Talks
Talks shouldn't last longer than 25 minutes, including the last 5 minutes dedicated to questions.
The topics covered should relate to programming and/ or technology and should be suitable for beginners, explaining even the most complex matter in a clear and engaging way.
In order to assure the talk's convenience we suggest to ask the speakers to review their slides and presentation structure together in advance. We're aware that it's quite an effort timewise, but it can really make the difference for your meetup (and, most important, your attendees).

2. Break
It should last around 5-10 minutes and will give everybody the chance to meet, discuss, socialize, relax.
Plus, a couple of things should be on the wall during the breaK:
    * a white board. It doesn't need to be a real board, a big paper sheet would do the job. Anyone can use it to ask for or offer help for a project, or propose a skill exchange (no money involved, please). A very good way to start a conversation.
    * a white sheet entitled "Learn'n'Tell": this is the list of available slots (not more than five) to talk at the upcoming Learn'n'Tell session. Anyone interested in doing so should write down her/ his name and topic of the intervention.

3. Learn'n'Tell session
Learn'n'Tell is inspired to Hack'n'Tell (happening in New York and Berlin), an event for hackers presenting their projects and getting a feedback from the audience. During our Learn'n'Tell session, beginners have 5 minutes to ask for a techie questions or show code they're working on (live coding is more than welcome!) and 5 minutes to receive a feedback from the audience (experienced developers are always joining the night also with the purpose to support the discussion). Important: have someone moderating the session and keeping an eye on the time!

# Pre-requirements

Make sure the workshop and its idea is in agreement with our [values](/values.html). In particular:
  * even though your workshop may be targeting a certain group of people (because of talk's topic, for example), it needs to be as open and inclusive as possible
  * you have to make sure that the event is enjoyable at a beginner's level
  * always remember that the Learners Meetup had to give beginners the chance to learn, (hopefully) get answers to their questions and present what they have created or discovered
  * you are responsible for creating a safe learning environment where learners are encouraged to ask questions and nothing is assumed to be "self-explanatory"

Have an idea of which are the topics you'd like to include - the clearer the idea, the easier it becomes to recruit speakers

Get in touch with OpenTechSchool people (which you might have already done via the mailinglist) and discuss your idea. Someone may already be working on something similar, so it makes sense to join forces.

In order to make the organisation easier, once you've contacted the OpenTechSchool team, find someone who is passionate about helping you organise the workshop from within OpenTechSchool or who has at least done such a thing before. We call this person "the co-host" and you are referred to as the "organizer". As this co-host might not have access to everything, this document refers to OTS as the organisation team in general.

# Starting to organize

Even if you already have a pretty clear idea of what you want to do, we strongly believe that more people working together yield bigger results. In any case, you want to have some other people helping you with organization, so the next things OTS is going to do are:

 * Provide a [mailing list] for all discussion related to Learners Meetups (https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/team.beginners-meetup).
Every message posted here will need to mention the city it belongs to.
E.g. "Amsterdam. Call for speakers for the upcoming Learners Meetup in May"

 * Promote that mailinglist via our social media channels, spread it in our mailinglist, user groups and communities

But we also need to you to spread the word and convince people to join - after all, it is your cause!

## Scheduling the first meeting
Once there are enough people who want to help organizing the event (we suggest at least 2-3), you can set up a first meeting in order to get to know each other as well as figure out how to actually get things done.

 * Create a [Doodle poll](http://www.doodle.com/) with potential dates in the next 2-4 weeks
 * Once the meeting is set, a notice about it is sent to the mailinglist.

_Note_: We recommend meeting on a weekday evening after work hours. Monday to Thursday work best in our experience.

## At the meeting

 * The meeting is moderated by the organizer and the co-host. This means you make sure the conversation does not get off track or lose productivity. You can ask for suggestions for the agenda at the beginning of the meeting to give it structure. Asking participants to raise their hands and wait for you to call on them before talking will help with maintain order, too.
 * Start with a short introduction round to hear everyone's name and interests/skills, as well as the motivation to be a co-organizer. You will find the information about this last point useful when trying to hammer out the goal/ learning purposes of the meetup.
 * Start discussing!

The usual goals for the first meeting are:
 * Getting to know the interests, motivation, goals, and availability of the co-organizers
 * Creating a plan for the next steps - this could be anything from a second meeting to talk more, setting up plans for creating/assembling learning materials, to the date and time for the workshop to take place.

## Planning the meetup
People, venue, drinks, a projector: the organizer's checklist!

 * Find speakers. Any tech related topic is more than welcome, from coding to understanding what an API is to getting to know an Arduino board.
 * Find a venue. We suggest trying to get in contact with co-working spaces, hacker spaces, start-ups who might want to offer their office for an OTS event – any space which would friendly join the OTS network and spirit (these are also kinds of spaces which usually already have a projector).
 * Find sponsors. This is optional. But you might want to offer some free drinks to the attendees, and in that case, a sponsor would be a nice addition to the event.
 * Find a date. Everybody is on board, time to put everything and everybody together. We suggest you to pick a weeknight (best is Tuesday - Friday), starting not later than 19:30 and going on for no longer than two hours (break included). Best would be already having in mind to have the meetup monthly – but this is not mandatory.
 * Find attendees: we can help! (If it doesn't already exists) we will set up an OTS Meetup account for your city (e.g. meetup.com/opentechschool-yourcity) and you'll be able to use it to communicate about the meetup and have people joining the event. Furthermore, we'll promote the event page through our social media channels, mailinglists, user groups and communities. But of course we also need you to spread the word and get people to join! A couple of days before the event write all the attendees a reminder e-mail asking them to update their RSVP status (in can the ycan't join, they'll free seats for people who might be in the waiting list).

## At the meetup
 * Be sure to get to the venue at least one hour in advance, and with at least another co-organizer, to set up the space, the projector and meet the speakers in advance
 * When the attendees start to arrive, someone from the organotazional team should greet them and ask them to write and wear their nametags (adhesive tags or simple writable tape are both great for this)
 * Have someone of the team moderating the event. When everybody is sitting, s/he should quickly introduce OTS, the meetup's structure and timetable, welcome the speakers on stage and lead the question time, encouragind everybody to feel at ease with sharing their curiosities. S/he should also announce start and end of the break time and handle the Learn'n'Tell session timewise.

## After the meetup

 * Invite everybody who joined the meetup to have a drink together! You can go to a nice bar nearby (so nobody gets lots and you can reach it in a snap) and take the chance to meet new people, get feedback from the attendees and spend some much deserved relaxing time with team members and speakers. Have fun!
