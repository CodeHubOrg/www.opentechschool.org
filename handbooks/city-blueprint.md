title: How to start OpenTechSchool in my city?
---

First things first: I won't be lying to you - starting something is always hard. And this might not only be hard but also very frustrating at times. Please do not give up, it is very important to us, so please do contact us in such a case and we see how we can help you.

This is a guide, a blueprint so to say, on how to make it easier to get the OpenTechSchool started at your city. Though we've done this before, it might be subject to change and there a might different things required for your place. If you have any notes, ideas or remarks - please let us know (or even better: create a pull request).

Alright. You are still reading this, this means you really seems to be interested in getting something started. Well the first thing for that, would be to **let us know about it**. There might already be people around you or we know about efforts and have contacts that can help you. So this is crucial: let us know!

# FIXME: write this out:

- How to start OTS at your own city/place/locallity:
 * you need to find a team of people interested in organising stuff - good starting point: talking to people organising other events on meetup.com in your city
 * try to find venues and companies sharing similar goals like OTS (like CoWorking-Spaces - is there theHub in your city - Hacker- and Makerspaces) and community interested initiatives and institutions (like univerities, townhalls etc.)
 * Finding coaches is essential: go to meetups and user groups, have a least one "Dev"-person with you talking about OTS - it makes talking to and recruiting coaches much easier if they are talking to a peer on the same eye level about that and not someone, who again wants something from them (for free)
 * For whatever meetup/workshop you do, it is ten times easier if there is one from the organisational team, who's already participated coaching/hosting that workshop somewhere before and knows what it is like, what is supposed to be and how to get there.
 * different city might need different approaches: don't push something because it worked somewhere else when it doesn't work there. Every city and every organisational team is different - and that is a good thing. Focus on the events you really want to do and are passionate about. That makes everything much easier and people are more likely to join you in your cause.

Make a Monthly meetup. Is important to keep the people on the loop.

Also:
 - Make mailing list and google group (at least the general one for start and again keep people informed)
If possible: Make social network! 

Try to find contacts:
- go to others meetup and make a small presentation about what OTS is
- keep in touch with similar groups
- Go in place like a university o big IT conference
- Talks with everybody about it! :)

Make a guideline about how a workshop schedule can be and how organize/prepare everything 
For example:
1. idea 
2. find space 
3. find coaches
4. meet coaches/ discuss about workshop / find a date / show guideline for coaches to coaches
5. prepare curriculum (who can do it)
6. create events
7 ...

Event:
11.00 partecipants arrive
11.30 introduction and installation 
12.00 .......

I think as soon as we are done with brainstorming we should meet and create something all together. 
It will be easier

Offering examples of standard written communication (to be taken as reference, not as a bible of course), like:
- what OTS is: slightly different versions for venues / coaches / universities / women-related events and organizations / conferences etc.
- Meetup.com-friendly copy and event related mailing (as suggested by Giorgia as well)
- examples and guidelines for social media and blog (as partly already suggested by Kristina in relation to "guidelines on how to pick the right pictures")
