## Introduction

Similar to our be asked for [promotion](/handbooks/promotion.html), we are also sometimes interested in partnering with others and co-organise events and workshops. As stated in promotion guidelines, we are supporting all initiatives and groups falling in line with our [values](/about.html#core_values). And while some just need promotional support (consult the promotion guidelines about that), sometimes we can and want to help more. This document is meant to help clearify what we do and how we do it.

## Contributions

There is quite a few things the OpenTechSchool can help with. And promoting an event is really just the smallest part. Much bigger are we on the backend side of things:

### Coaches
We have a huge network of coaches on various topics and in many fields all around the globe. If you can not scale up your event because you are missing more people helping you coach others, poke us.

### Material
We also have a growing directory of learners material ready and available as open source. Feel free to use that without any further communication (though we are happy know where it gets used).

### Organisational Help
We are organising these events all the time. We have experience and a huge network of supporters, especiall when it comes to hands-on workshops. If you need help organising your event, that is what we are there for.

### Diversity
We also have plenty of experience shaping events to make them more interesting for a more diverse audience and we'd love to help you on that part

## Naming / Branding
We do consider ourself a supporting meta-community. That means we do not require to be the official part of events brand/event for everthing. We might as for that if the event wouldn't happen without our contribution but generally it is enough for us if it is clearly pointed out, what the OpenTechSchool provided or contributed to the event.

Any other mentioning of OpenTechSchool is of course highly appreciated and helps motivate to spread the word more, but isn't required to be offically supported by us.

### Official vs. Non-Official
Sometimes we come to the conclusion that the event doesn't follow our guidelines or we do not want to officially support it/be named  for other reasons. But that doesn't mean the people are not allowed to still help. Maybe it is just a friend and you want to help out. And that is ok, just make clear that you are not doing it as an official OpenTechSchool person and don't use any official means of communication. 

## Requirements towards the partner

Aside from the official naming, make sure the partner is aware of the following:

 * we are still free to promote or not promote the event and the support-and-sponsorship rules still apply to them to
 * any material created for or within workshops have to be released as Open Source to the public
 * we might name ourself supporter of the event (stating what we contribute)

If it is a co-partnered event also make sure that:
 
 * the other partners are aware of the [values](/about.html#core_values) of OpenTechSchool - especially about it being free
 * it is made clear that any audio and visual material created of the event by the partners, will be shared freely - as in no-restricitons of use - between each other
 * make sure the spelling is correct: "OpenTechSchool" - one word, CamelCased

## Promoting the event

The more involved and the more prominent the more likely OpenTechSchool wants to promote the event, too. But just because there is an (in-)official partnership doesn't mean that the partner has rights to call what is promoted and how. The [promotion](/handbooks/promotion.html) and [sponsorship and support guidelines](/handbooks/sponsorship-and-support.html) still apply.

## Decisions
The decisions who to partner with and which events to support lies in the hand of those doing it and the local team around it. If the event happens in Dortmund, it is decision of Team Dortmund whether to support and in what way.
