## How we decide on stuff

A practical guide for new OpenTechSchool members. 

## The doers have the call

First things first: We do belive in doing instead of talking. So in doubt the person who is actually doing it, has the voting rights. It is not our decision on how that person wants to the stuff, if we are not willing to take action in our own hands. Of course you are allowed to advice but don't be a jerk and try to make someone do something they don't want to do. This is also true for the handbooks; if you are doing it and you have an idea on how to do it better, do it instead and don't forget to [let us know](/contacts.html) so that we can update our material.

### On conceptional questions
But some questions you want to discuss. Now the first step is obviously to figure out the audience to talk to. If is it specific questions about blog posts or similar, you might wanna ask the [appropriate team](/contacts.html). They probably have a good idea what to do about it. For example: you receive an inquiry about some workshop that OTS might or might not want to promote in the social streams, just send it to [team communications](mailto:team.communications[at]opentechschool.org) and they'll take care of it.

#### But what happens then?
Now, let's go further with that example: if that question is a no-brainer one in the team is probably just going to promote it rather quickly. If that decision instead is not that easy, because it might does not fall in line with our [promotion guidelines](/handbooks/promotion.html), everyone within that team votes with a simple +1 or -1 on the inquiry. Once a majority is met either pro or against it, the decision is taken and action might follows.

In some cases that team might also includes other teams that are touched by such a decision in that process. For example the learners meetup team.

### It ain't that of a problematic topic
Well, then, you probably want to take the discussion onto the [public mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/discuss.global) then to get the discussion going.

Once one or a few opions emerge you might want to put them up for vote via a [doole](http://doodle.com) and send that link to the same list. Once there has been no addition to list for a few days, remind everyone via another email that they can still vote and once another few days passed, take a screenshot of the results and post that as the decision to the mailinglist.

That is it. Happy voting.
