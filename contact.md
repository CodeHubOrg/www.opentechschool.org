## Email

We organise our work in teams taking care of certain aspects. Please feel free to email to the one directly you think is most appropriate for your inquiry. 

Those lists are:

 * OpenTechSchool Global: The [public discussion group](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/discuss.global) accessible and visible to everyone to discuss all topics around OTS. This is a great place to email to if you want to connect with OTSlers in your city or around a certain topic which does not yet have its [own coaching group](/handbooks/mailinglists.html#coaches_lists).

 * [Team Beginners Meetup](mailto:team.beginners-meetup[at]opentechschool.org) organises the Beginner- and Learner-Meetups. If you have an interesting proposal, want to talk about something or connect one of the organisers about anything, this is where your email should go.

 * [Team Sponsors](team.sponsors[at]opentechschool.org) takes care of the sponsorship of events like meetups and workshops. If you are interested in sponsoring one of our events, either with money, food or by offering a venue, let them know.

 * [Team Content](mailto:team.content[at]opentechschool.org) also known as _Team Rocket_ is in charge of blog posts and copy-editing. If you have a blog post you'd like to have published on the OTS-Blog or you are presenting OTS somewhere and want to have it reviews, ask here.

 * [Team Communications](mailto:team.communications[at]opentechschool.org) takes care of all online and offline communications of OTS. Either you have something you think OTS would like to tweet or facebook or you are interested of us speaking at your event/conference, send your emails here.

 * [Team Blueprint](team.blueprint[at]opentechschool.org) is in charge of the [handbooks](/handbooks/). If you find any mistake, have feedback or want more information about a specific part, send your email here.

 * [Team Tech](mailto:team.tech[at]opentechschool.org) organises the tech parts of OTS, for example the github accounts, email-adresses and domains and stuff. So if you need a mailinglist or something of the former mentioned, send your email here.

## Chat / IRC

## In person

Always feel free to come to us after any Learners Meetup, during the bi-weekly OpenTechSchool Breakfast we do at [co.up](http://co-up.de) or any other workshop and event and speak with us. And if you're unsure who to talk to, just ask one of us, the first you see!
