But what after you've gotten yourself into coding through our workshops? How do you continue learning? What if you get stuck with your project? That's exactly what the OpenTechSchool Continuous Learning Groups are there for. Meeting weekly or bi-weekly on weekday evenings, these Groups always have coaches there to help you, while each one just continues on their project in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.

Learning Groups are normally managed through the usual meetup groups. Currently two groups exist in Berlin, one focussed on Javascript meeting every Wednesday and one for Python meeting every second Monday.
